# Giant-project
Purpose:
To ensure smooth cross-team integration, all code and related documentation must be maintained in this single GitHub repository.

Centralised version control allows every team to access and review each otherâ€™s work and guarantees that the different software and hardware components can be connected without last-minute conflicts.

Repository Structure
Create a top-level folder named after your team (e.g. navigation/, hardware/, software/).


Within your team folder, organise code and resources in sub-folders as required.


Every team folder must include a README.md file that clearly explains:


the purpose of the code or documents in that folder,


key dependencies or ROS packages used,


instructions for building or running the code.


This practice will make it easier for other teams to understand and integrate your work.
